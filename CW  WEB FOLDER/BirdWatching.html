	<p>Sri Lanka is a wonderful destination for bird watching with an incredible 33 species of endemic birds and 441 species of birds recorded on the island!</p><hr>
	<h4>Sinharaja Rainforest</h4>
	<p>Our Naturalists would not miss an opportunity to linger longer in this beautiful rain forest. It is the last remaining virgin rain-forest in the island where, a day out
	on safari can yield 29 of the island’s 33 endemic birds.</p>
	<img src="222.jpg" alt="bird2" width="500px" class="first">
	<h4>What Can You See Inside Sinharaja?</h4>
	<p>Some of the noteworthy species could include: the Oriental Honey Buzzard, Ceylon Spurfowl and Junglefowl, Ceylon Woodpigeon, Red-Faced Malkoha, Green-Billed Coucal,
	Chestnut-Winged Cuckoo, Serendib Scops-Owl, Chestnut-Backed Owlet, Ceylon Frogmouth, Malabar Trogon, many species of Eagles including; Rufous-Bellied Eagle, Shikra, Crested 
	Serpent Eagle, Black Eagle and Mountain Hawk-Eagle; Yellow-Browed Bulbul, Himalayan Black Bulbul, Spot-Winged Ground Thrush, Ceylon Scaly Thrush, Ceylon Rufous Babbler, 
	Ashy-Headed Laughing Thrush, Asian Paradise Flycatcher, Indian Paradise Fly catcher, Ceylon Blue Magpie, White-Faced Starling, Ceylon Hill-Myna and more</p>

	<h4>Horton Plains National Park and the Kitulgala Forests </h4>
	<p>If ticking off the 33 endemics of Sri Lanka is on your bucket list, then these are two must visit birding hot spots in Sri Lanka.</p>

	<h4>What Can You See Inside Horton Plains and Kitulgala?</h4>
	<p>Waking up before dawn can certainly reward you with sightings of the Yellow-eared Bulbul, Ceylon Scimitar-babbler, Sri Lanka Bush Warbler, and Sri Lanka White-eye to name a
	few in the Horton Plains cloud forests, Sri Lanka's most visited National Park. In Kitulgala, across the famed river is a lush rain forest which is home to the Chestnut-backed
	Owlet and Serendib Scops Owl, while you may also spot the two species of Barbets: Yellow-fronted Barbet and Ceylon Small Barbet, and Green-billed Coucal, Layard’s Parakeet, and 
	the Ceylon Rufous Babbler.</p>

	<h4>RAMSAR Sites of Mannar and Bundala National Parks </h4>
	<p>Sri Lanka Migrant hotspots where hundreds of winter migrants arrive for feeding during October until April. Mannar is a great location to photograph Flamingos, Water birds 
	and Shorebirds and is a less frequently visited spot on the main birding routes.</p>

	<h4>What Can You See Inside Bundala?</h4>
	<p>A morning safari in Bundala is one of the highlights of any birding tour in Sri Lanka. Sandpipers and Plovers abound among Crocodiles and migrant shorebirds. Curlew 
	Sandpipers, Wood Sandpipers and Common sandpipers, Pacific Golden Plovers, Kentish and Little Ringed Plovers mingle in the marshes and lakes with Common Redshanks, Pheasant-tailed
	Jacana, Black Bitterns and Yellow Bitterns.</p>
	<hr>
	<h4>Kumana, Yala, Wilpattu and Uda Walawe National Parks and Sigiriya Sanctuary</h4>
	<p>A walk around these National Parks is almost as good as a safari inside them for spotting migrants as well as endemic birds of Sri Lanka. Most of our tours with specialist
	Naturalists would include treks in the borders surrounding these birding hot spots.</p>
